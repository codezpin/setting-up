# Setting-up macbook to work
This repository was created to make it easier for me to configure my MacBook, as sometimes I forget to properly configure some program that I need.
You have to search all this again on the Internet, the necessary links are lost in history or simply deleted.
Regular notes are not very suitable for this, as they are not very convenient for me.
And github is an ideal tool that can also be used as a memo, a note with clear instructions. 
And you can also work on your own projects here, so it's two in one. :))
